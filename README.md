## üìå Introduction  
Businesses often measure engagement through **likes, shares, and comments (SoE)**. However, these metrics don‚Äôt reveal whether feedback is relevant, meaningful, or positive/negative in sentiment.  
**CommentSense** addresses this by analyzing the **quality, relevance, and sentiment** of comments at scale, while filtering out spam and noise to uncover true customer insights.  

---

## üö© Problem Statement  
- How can we measure the **ratio of quality comments**?  
- How do we determine the **relevance and sentiment** of comments?  
- Can comments be filtered out by **categorization**?  
- How do we detect and filter **spam comments**?  

---

## üí° Our Solution  
We designed an **end-to-end pipeline** consisting of five main modules:  
1. **Translation Module** ‚Äì Handles multilingual and mixed-language comments.  
2. **Spam Detection Module** ‚Äì Identifies and removes noise or irrelevant text.  
3. **Categorization Module** ‚Äì Groups comments into product categories like skincare and makeup.  
4. **Sentiment Analysis Module** ‚Äì Detects emotions and overall sentiment such as positive, negative, or neutral.  
5. **Comment Quality Module** ‚Äì Scores comments based on relevance, sentiment, and engagement.

## üõ† Development Tools  
- **Translation**: `langdetect` + `deep-translator`  
- **Spam Detection**: `madhurjindal/autonlp-Gibberish-Detector-492513457` (pre-trained model from Hugging Face)  
- **Categorization**: `facebook/bart-large-mnli` (Zero-Shot Classification)  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: DistilBERT + Graph Neural Network Refiner (GoEmotions dataset)  
- **Environment**: Python, Jupyter, Hugging Face Transformers  

---

## üîé Methodology  

### 1. Translation 
- Translate multilingual comments to English with context-aware translation.  

### 2. Text Preprocessing
- Standardize text: lowercasing, expanding contractions and short forms, cleaning, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords.  

### 3. Spam Detection  
- Implemented a pre-trained Hugging Face model.  
- ‚ÄúNoise‚Äù classified as spam and removed.  

### 4. Categorization  
- Zero-shot classification groups comments into relevant product categories.  

### 5. Sentiment Analysis  
- **DistilBERT + GNN Refiner**  
  - Captures semantic meaning and emotion co-occurrence.  
  - Trained on the **GoEmotions dataset** (27 fine-grained emotions + neutral).  
  - Strong performance on short forms, slang, and informal text.  
- Emotions are mapped into **positive, negative, neutral** sentiments.  

### 6. Comment Quality Scoring  
- Weighted score: **0.5 √ó Relevance + 0.3 √ó Sentiment + 0.2 √ó Engagement**  
- Normalized to [0‚Äì1] scale.  
- Spam comments automatically assigned a score of 0.
